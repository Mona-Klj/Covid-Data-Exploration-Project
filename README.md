# Covid-Data-Exploration-Project
This Repository will hold all of the code and queries from the Covid-Data-Exploration-Project we create.

Data source from : https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths .

we seprate two tables from raw data called Covid_Deaths and Covid_Vaccinations.

There are some SQL queries on the tables to extract some meaning from the raw data tables.
