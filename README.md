## Covid-Data-Exploration-Project

This Repository holds all of the codes and queries from the Covid-Data-Exploration-Project I have created.

Data source from: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.

I separate two tables from raw data called Covid_Deaths and Covid_Vaccinations.

There are some SQL queries on the tables to extract some meaning from the raw data tables.
